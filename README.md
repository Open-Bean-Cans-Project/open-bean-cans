# open-bean-cans

Today we live in an era that has been shaped by Open-Source softwware. The benefits of living in an era of open-source are immeasurable. The world's most advanced [operating system](https://biebian.sourceforge.net/), [language interpreter](https://github.com/brain-lang/brainfuck), and [library](https://github.com/aneopsy/LibraryOfBabel) are all the cumulative effort of thousands of volunteers from across the globe. In addition, Open-Source software has revolutionized [sanitation](https://github.com/uraniumreza/ToiletFinder), [preparation for disaster response](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/OpenSourceGuide-ZombieApocalypse.pdf), and [UI design](https://github.com/cowsay-org/cowsay).

Despite these advances, most source code is still strictly kept secret, trapped under nondisclosure agreements or under copyright by large corporations.

Today, sophisticated software enables bean cans to preserve their contents nearly indefinitely, but it has remained so elusive that the majority of software developers have never acknowledged the existence of said software. This project aims to raise awareness of bean cans by maintaining the state-of-the-art open-source alternative to existing bean can software. Our long-term mission is to improve said software for more sustainable preservation of the earth's ever-depleting resources.
