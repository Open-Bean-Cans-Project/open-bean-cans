Today we live in an era that has been shaped by Open-Source software. The benefits of living in an era of open-source are immeasurable. The world's most advanced [operating system](https://biebian.sourceforge.net/), [language interpreter](https://github.com/brain-lang/brainfuck), and [library](https://github.com/aneopsy/LibraryOfBabel) are all the cumulative effort of thousands of volunteers from across the globe. In addition, Open-Source software has revolutionized everying from [sanitation](https://github.com/uraniumreza/ToiletFinder), to [preparation for disaster response](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/OpenSourceGuide-ZombieApocalypse.pdf), to [UI design](https://github.com/cowsay-org/cowsay).

Despite these advances, most source code is still strictly kept secret, trapped under nondisclosure agreements or under copyright by large corporations.

Today, sophisticated software enables bean cans to preserve their contents nearly indefinitely, but the codebase remains so elusive that most software developers don't even recognize its existence. 

The commuinity behind this project aims to raise awareness of bean cans by maintaining the state-of-the-art open-source alternative to existing bean can software. We strive to continuously improve bean can software for more sustainable preservation of the earth's ever-depleting resources.
